Disaster Recovery

Once again, using the IT Disaster Recovery Plan Workbook and Template create an IT Disaster Recovery Plan.

For a business or organization of your choosing.

The company/organization should be a medium sized organization with an increased complexity over the organization you chose for project one.

The organization should have three geographically separate locations.

The locations should be distanced at least 300 miles apart from each other.

Two of the locations should also be in different countries, do not choose more than two countries to have the organization operating in as the project will quickly become too extensive to complete.

Additionally, do not chose more than three locations to have the company operating in (three locations and two countries is the scope).

The countries can also be located within the same continent.

You will need to be able to gather or develop the following information:

The departments needed for the company to operate (IT, HR, legal, marketing, customer service)

An organizational chart depicting roles within the organization this will be based on the departments needed for the organization to operate

The type of platforms or systems used to operate the day to day functions the company is involved with. These do not need to be specific brands but just what they are and what they do will suffice. For example, an ERP system in the cloud for financial information, Email system on premise, file servers on premise, etc.

o This should consist of the computers/laptops, servers, infrastructure, if the organization is a manufacturer, then list that they will need manufacturing equipment no need to be specific as to the name of the machines etc.

o Do they need real time redundancy for everything? Or is a nightly backup good enough for certain systems?

o How much down time can each system withstand? (1hour,24hours,1week,1month)

Geographic location(s)

o Where are they located? (Is this location susceptible to any severe weather or earthquakes?)

o What countries do they operate in? How does this affect them from a legal, regulatory perspective?

Who are their business partners â€“ you do not need to name specific names of companies just what type of companies do they rely on to do business? or what kind of supplies do they need to operate?

Are there any regulations they required to adhere to? (SOX, HIPAA, GDPR) Through brainstorming among your group conduct a business impact analysis:

Determine what the critical systems are for the organization and how long can they be down for.
